# Health-Tracker-2.0

My mission -

My name is Yuhyun and I have always been interested in nutrition and health as far as I can remember. In the past I have experimented with apps to show my progress and always found that there were few features that were lacking that I wished it had. To suppliment all the features I wanted I ended up having dozen or more apps on my phone which became more of a hassle and also found myself always struggling to remember all the different apps that did different things. Thats when I decided to make my own app that can do everything in one with easy to use UI that makes keeping track of my health a breeze.

Developer note - 

The app is written in Vue.js framework and hosted by AWS to handle backend support. The nutrition fact data comes from USDA API. To get started you will need to install NPM to install all the necessary libraries and also git to work off of the master branch.

To start the development server, type in npm run serve in your console.

To make code lines clean and uniform it is running prettier plugin. You can run the npm run format to match the code style to others who are contributing.

If you want to work on one of the issues listed in the issues tab, please leave a comment stating that you would like to work on the issue so that the designee can assign you as the main coder. You can fork the master branch and create a new branch off of the master fork by typing in git checkout -b (branch name). I do advise that you name the branch after the issue you are working on so that it is easy to locate and track. If you create a PR you can link it to the issue by typing Fixes #(issue number) in the description.
