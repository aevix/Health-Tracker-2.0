# Health-Tracker-2.0
My name is Yuhyun and I have always struggled with weightloss as far as I can remember. I used different apps to show my progress and always found that there were few features that were lacking that I wish it had. In the past I would download a handful of apps to keep track of all the data and information to guide my journey. At the end of the day I ended up having dozen or more apps on my phone which became more of a hassle than convenience to try and find the right app to keep track of basic things. Thats when I decided that it would be nice to have an all-in-one app that had everything so I can look at all the data with one touch. I hope this app will become a powerful tool for those who are serious about their health.
