# Health-Tracker-2.0

My mission -

My name is Yuhyun and I have always been interested in nutrition and health as far as I can remember. In the past I have experimented with apps to show my progress and always found that there were few features that were lacking that I wished it had. To suppliment all the features I wanted I ended up having dozen or more apps on my phone which became more of a hassle and also found myself always struggling to remember all the different apps that did different things. Thats when I decided to make my own app that can do everything in one with easy to use UI that makes keeping track of my health a breeze.

Developer note - 

The app is written in Vue.js framework and hosted by AWS to handle backend support. The nutrition fact data comes from USDA API.
