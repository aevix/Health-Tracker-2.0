# Health-Tracker-2.0

My mission -

My name is Yuhyun and I have always been interested in nutrition and health as far as I can remember. I used different apps to show my progress and always found that there were few features that were lacking that I wish it had. In the past I would download a handful of apps to keep track of all the data and information to keep track of my progress. I ended up having dozen or more apps on my phone which became more of a hassle than convenience to try and find the right app to keep track of basic informations. Thats when I decided to create an all-in-one app that had everything in one app so I can look at all the data with one touch. I hope this app will become a powerful tool for those who are serious about their health.
